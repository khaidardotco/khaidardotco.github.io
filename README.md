Trying to decide whether i should redesign and rewrite from scratch my site that is currently hosted on Netlify. 
Cause, oh boi! Do I hate looking at default template, being bound by the limitations of static generator, and realize inevitability of ditching it in favor of something more flexible?

The time will tell — meanwhile tho — imma learn some web!
